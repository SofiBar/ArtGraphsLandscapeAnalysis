Although cassoni were painted by some of the most important artists, the majority were produced by anonymous decorative painters. This panel, from one such cassone, depicts the Roman general Horatius Cocles defending the bridge to Rome against the Etruscans.

The image can be interpreted as an admonition to praise God with singing and music-making, but also as a risqué scene of seduction. The young woman’s gaudy garments and red shoes are in questionable taste, and the old woman looks suspiciously like a procuress. Perhaps the painting contains a warning against immoral conduct.

He presided in the Castle of Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia), a fort built by the Dutch. The assembly hall in the Castle of Batavia was the centre of Dutch power in Asia. The walls were hung with portraits of all of the governors-general. Most of the 18th-century examples shown here were painted in Asia, often by anony¬mous artists.

He was exiled, but allowed to return under King Louis Napoleon. On the table is Bilderdijk’s uncompleted epic poem, The Destruction of the First World, written for Louis Napoleon. Sixth months later, the King abdicated, and Bilderdijk was once again deprived of a protector.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3999	Apollonio di Giovanni was one of the most prominent cassone specialists in Florence. Cassoni (chests) were often produced in pairs, mostly on the occasion of marriages, with depictions of heroic deeds. Here, the Persian ruler Darius is shown going to battle against Alexander the Great.

With an intense sense of joie de vivre, Wouters succeeded here in enhancing the room around him. To him, daily life was always beautiful and pleasant. Nature was his principal source of inspiration. As an Impressionist, he considered our observation of nature to be a constant challenge. He painted, modelled and drew all aspects of life around him. The figure in the painting, Wouters' wife Nel, looks up from her ironing board unaffectedly. Beside her stands a basket with more clothes for ironing; behind her on the mantelpiece, a vase with flowers and a bell-jar, objects that capture and reflect the intense and shimmering light, with its subtle variations of soft yellow, pale pink and diluted green.

He appears here as a European dandy, seated before a Western seascape. Soon, how-ever, he specialized in exotic scenes and began dressing as an oriental prince. Back on Java (1851), Raden Saleh built a Gothic Revival palace and socialized with the European elite, flitting between
his Javanese and European identity."

Her art underwent a transformation in the early 1950s, and became more abstract. Particularly fascinated by the Norwegian landscapes, nature and arctic light, she developed a form of abstracted landscapes and scenery based on her travels in North of Norway.  She is one of Norway’s modernist artists of the 1950’s and cultivated a formal idiom that focused on a handful of archetypal abstracted motifs within themes such as rocks, celestial bodies, mountains, fjords, horizons, boats and steles.

The painting N°2-1966 Finnmark Hiver, PVA and metal foil on canvas, 150 x 300 cm is an abstracted image of the arctic landscape from the most northern part of Norway close to the Russian border. Horizontally the image presents dark and light parts that show the contrasting rendering of a landscape in the dark winter season of northern  Norway. Bergman developed her painting technique by applying layers of metal foils and PVA on the canvas. In the lower part, reflecting silver foils depict the snow together with darker grey and yellow grassy parts of color. The silver both reflects and alludes inner light and enforces the shadow effects. Fragments of reindeer lichen emerges through the snow as darker grey spots and lets the reindeer grass its only nourishment. The relationship between the light landscape and the pitch black is creating a perspectival effect offering the viewer to gaze above and beyond the alpine tundra of Finnmarksvidda."

In 1590 Maurice was also given command of the armed and naval forces. Maurice (1567-1625) is portrayed wearing the
gilded and engraved ceremonial armour that the States-General presented to him for his victory at the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600)."

At that time, the Portuguese military position on the Malabar Coast had been seriously diminished so the company met with virtually no resistance. The region produced pepper and cardamom, the latter spice used to make sweet biscuits. The company ultimately lost Cannanore to the English.

At the right a statue has been brutally hacked in half. In August 1566 fanatic Protestants destroyed altarpieces, statues and sacred vessels used for the Catholic Mass in countless churches throughout the Netherlands. It was a black day in Dutch history, and one rarely depicted in art.

The nobleman was one of the chief supporters of Emperor Charles V, serving him in all kinds of important administrative roles.

The family is gathered around the table on which there are scattered jewels, gemstones and other precious products. In the background there opens a view of the gem-cutting workshop, its´ operation is depicted quite faithfully. On top of the sideboard on the left there are displayed various crystal vessels. One of them, called Pyramid, completed by 1653, provides the clue for the dating.

They are based on Christ’s teachings, as described in the Gospel of Matthew. Sweerts painted his series of – four of which four pictures are in the Rijksmuseum – while in Rome. His humble street scenes depict the

The tally of the drinks he has consumed is chalked up on the slate behind him. The beer barrel at the left bears the mark of Het Rode Hert (The Red Hart), an Amsterdam brewery on the Prinsengracht. Metsu was living next door to it around 1650.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_426	In 1613, the Dutch parliament (States General) commissioned Otto van Veen to paint twelve paintings depicting the revolt of the Batavians against the Romans in AD 69 and 70. These were displayed in Binnenhof, the central government building in The Hague. In the early years of the Dutch Republic, many compared their own revolt against Spain to the Batavian uprising.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_294	"A painted sheet of paper at the lower left describes the subject: the battle between the Dutch and English
fleets off the Italian port of Livorno (Leghorn). Victory brought the Dutch control over trade in the Mediterranean. Nooms almost certainly painted the canvas for the Chamber of Levantine Trade in Amsterdam."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_1105	Van Os spent his career mainly in Paris, where he painted porcelain for the famous Sèvres factory. At the same time, he created a furore with magnificently painted floral still lifes incorporating antique art objects. These two paintings probably belong to a series of the Four Seasons. In this painting of Spring, the flowers are arranged in a Greek vase.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3892	The beautiful Bathsheba bathes out of doors assisted by two maidservants. King David spies the young woman from the roof of his palace and instantly falls in love. Although he is not depicted in the painting, David’s presence is suggested by the castle in the distance. Curiously, the servant seen from behind has a male body.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2150	The painter Geertgen tot Sint-Jans lived in Haarlem in the monastery of the Sint-Jansheren (the Commandery of the Knights of Saint John), from which he took his name.The three magi represent the three generations and hail from the three continents known in the Middle Ages: Europe, Asia and Africa. They are paying tribute to the newborn baby Jesus.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_1460	In 1812 Napoleon suffered a series of major defeats which allowed William Frederick, Prince of Orange-Nassau, to return to the Netherlands as monarch in 1813. A month after Napoleon’s escape from Elba, he proclaimed himself King of the United Netherlands (now the Netherlands and Belgium) and Duke of Luxemburg. After the Battle of Waterloo he was inaugurated in 1815 as King William I.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2704	Matthijs Maris claimed to have painted this picture in a single week in order to earn some quick cash. Maris, who lived in Paris, used a stereoscopic photograph of Amsterdam as his point of departure. He altered the photographic image and painted high-rise Parisian apartment buildings in the distance. The result is a dreamlike 19th-century cityscape, which reveals ever more details the longer one looks at it.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_200	Three men and a woman discuss daily matters, and a child eats soup or porridge while a dog looks on. Peasant life does not seem at all bad. In Van Ostade’s early works, peasants regularly tumble over one another brawling, but in his later paintings, like this one, they are usually calmer and much more collected.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063625/HU_280_007	Szinyei, who as a painter was firmly opposed to the public taste for blindly worshiping tradition, left Munich after completing Picnic in May in 1873, only returning there in his old age to receive an award. Unlike some of his compatriots, he did not move on to France to draw further inspiration for his innovative type of art, but went back to his homeland to marry his bride. In the village of Jernye, his growing family, his day-to-day problems and the unstimulating, rural environment conspired against any deep immersion in art. In 1878, however, the boldness of his youthful paintings gushed forth once more: the optimism he felt at the time can be seen in one of his most original conceptions, Balloon. The artist had long been intrigued by technical innovations – during his years at the Academy, he had once tried to construct an airplane – so a balloon trip taken by his brother-in-law immediately captured his imagination. Szinyei would have loved most of all to take part in the ascent, for up in the air a man can forget about all the trifling affairs of his fellowmen swarming down on the ground. In his painting, the conquest over gravity thus becomes a symbol both for human thought taking flight and for artistic freedom.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3902	Seventeen-year-old Ottavio Strada is portrayed in an unusual – allegorical – manner. He receives a cornucopia filled with ancient coins from Fortune, while turning away from a statue of Venus. The gold and silver signify not only his future riches, but also allude to his study of ancient coins, a pursuit in which he was trained by his father, the antiquary Jacopo Strada.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063603/LIT_280_001	It is one of the oldest easel paintings in Lithuania, closely linked to Vytautas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania (reigning 1401-1430), and early Christianisation in Lithuania. Up until nowadays this image is considered to be miraculous and is an object of devotion not only for Catholic and Orthodox Christians, but also for local Muslims. Numerous ex-votos (gratitude gifts from pilgrims) displayed around the painting testifies such devotion.  Regarding the origin of the painting there are many legends but very little historical evidence to justify the stories. For example, an inscription on the back of the painting from the early 18th century states that it was given as a gift to Vytautas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, on the occasion of his Baptism in 1386 by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1350-1425). Inscription also states that this is the icon Nikopoia (Greek for “She who brings Victory”), which helped the Emperor John II Komnenos (1087-1143) to break through the Persian siege and successfully return to Constantinople. However, this inscription most likely was made shortly before 1718, when the image was adorned with crowns sent by Pope Clement XI from Rome and granted the title “Intercessor of Sick”. The painting of Trakai Mother of God stands out because of a unique combination of Byzantine, Medieval and Baroque styles. Research performed during the restoration of the painting shows that the oldest layer of paint contains a Late Gothic style full-figure image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Originally the Mother of God was portrayed with her hair uncovered except for a transparent veil and perhaps wearing a crown of roses. However, at the start of the 17th century the painting seemed disproportionately large for a new central altar being installed in the Church. As a result the lower-part of the painting was trimmed. At the same time the background was engraved and gilded anew and the figure of Mary was repainted with Byzantine characteristics. Head and brow of the Mother of God were now covered not with a veil, but with heavy folds of cape. The image, as seen by pilgrims today, shows the Mother of God in the Hodegetria icon style. She is seated and looking towards the viewer. Christ the Child wearing a purple tunic sits on her right knee. He holds a book in his right hand and with his left hand reaches out to three roses with three blossoms each, held by the Mother of God. These roses symbolize the mysteries of the Rosary. There is a Greek cross painted on the forehead area of the cape and a star on the left shoulder. In Marian icons stars on the forehead and shoulder indicate the Virgin’s chastity. The painting is characterized, on the one hand, by the Byzantine iconographic scheme that seems to set its figures apart from earthly reality. At the same time, it also shows traits of Western European painting tradition during the late Middle Ages. In particular, broad clothing that conceals the figure under its folds and an idealized face that recalls the 15th century “completely beautiful” images of Mary (Tota Pulchra). Finally, the image of Trakai’ Mother of God is covered in gilded silver plate dating 1723-1724 made by Johann Friedrich Schömnick. The heads of Mary and Child are covered with the early 18th century crowns.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_180	The man wearing extravagant Italian-looking clothing takes us by surprise. He appears from behind a tapestry and leans out of the window. He tries to engage with the viewer in order to clink glasses. So lifelike and convincing is Honthorst’s rendering that the fiddler seems to have slipped out from the frame of the painting to join us.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_1610	"A grey horse, whose reins are held by a boy, plays the leading role in this small panel. The horse stands out
clearly against the dramatic cloudy sky. Wouwerman’s rendering of the animal with its almost palpable coat
is very lifelike. By choosing a low vantage point, the artist strengthened the painting’s monumental effect."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2102	So many flowers in a small glass of water! This must have made an exceedingly lavish impression on a 17th-century viewer. Flowers were expensive at the time; gardens would have had only a few flowers, surrounded by much greenery. Jan Brueghel II was a faithful follower of his father Jan Brueghel I. This sparkling still life is a variant of a painting by his father.

The scene is the start of the lottery ticket sales organized by the States General on 25 October 1779. This was the immediate forerunner of the National Lottery, which still exists, as does the house seen here.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_772	Jacob Marrel’s specialized in ‘portraits’ of tulips in bloom. Tulip bulbs were collected fanatically in 17th-century Holland, and astronomical prices were sometimes paid for a single bulb. In this painting as well, tulips play a leading role. The whimsically shaped red-and-white and red-and-yellow striped tulips were especially prized. Although nature creates them, it also lets them wither and die – just like the dead frog at the right.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4970	Valckenburgh was married to Dina Lems, daughter of a high-ranking official of the Dutch East India Company. Her extensive pearls attest to her wealth. Both Dina’s father and her husband amassed fortunes in the trade of slaves, ivory and gold. They also handled the sort of pepper seeds known as ‘grains of paradise’, grown on the west coast of Africa. Not for nothing then does Dina point at the pepper plant next to her.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063620/GRE_280_06	Great painter Nikolaos Gyzis had strong religious and metaphysical feelings and questions in the latter part of his life. It is in this context that the magnificent, transcendental work on the Second Coming was born. The artist did many studies in preparation for this work. Some of them, verging on the abstract, their protagonist being the light, are on display adjacent to this work. Christ appears on the throne, illuminated against a golden-purple background. Golden clouds form homocentric circles around him. Golden rays emanate from the figure of Christ across the entire work. The Coming of the Saviour is heralded by four angels with trumpets, while Archangel Gabriel is flying above on the top of the composition. Myriads of angels are kneeling on the great staircase which frames the scene, leading to Christ, celebrating his coming. The work is also inspired by the Apocalypse of St John, but Gyzis, as he wrote in a letter, did not see Christ as a punisher and avenger, but as a sweet god who came to bring to the world light, salvation and comfort.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2312	This ‘memorial tablet’ was painted in commemoration of the four canons depicted on it. The partially decayed corpse in the open tomb reminds the viewer of his own mortality and asks for his prayers: ‘Whoever passes by, look and weep. What you are, I once was, what I am, you will become, I beseech you to pray for me’.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_197	Upper-class Dutchmen aspired to the life of an English gentleman. The fabulously rich banker and art collector Adriaan van der Hoop owned racehorses and, like members of the English aristocracy, had portraits made of his prizewinners. The picture’s style is also English: the horse is painted in profile, in cool bright tones, set in a sober composition. The horse stands in a meadow in Van der Hoop’s estate near Haarlem.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_793	Jan van Kessel painted different kinds of beetles, flies and butterflies near a sprig of white currants with almost scientific accuracy. He relied on illustrations in scientific books on entomology as well as the actual insects themselves. This little painting reflects the sense of curiosity, discovery, wonder, as well as the urge to collect that led to the creation of many cabinets of art and curiosities in the artist’s time.

http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4922	"Dujardin not only painted landscapes with Italian flair, but also large history paintings inspired by Italian
examples. Here, the Apostle Paul towers above a group of sick people. When he heals a crippled man in the
name of the Christian god, the onlookers take him to be the heathen god Mercury. Dujardin understood the
art of using figural gestures to enhance the pathos and drama of a scene."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_662	Amsterdam’s cultural elite met up in this book and print shop. Warnars, the owner, was a bookdealer, publisher and printer. These activities are reflected in the full bookcases, the hanging banner, the packages of printed matter and the printing press on the floor. The painter of this scene, Johannes Jelgerhuis, was also a noted actor. The pronounced perspective of the shop interior makes it look like a stage set with a city view as a backdrop.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3924	Pompeius Occo (1483–1537) came from a north German family and grew up in Augsburg. In 1511 he settled in Amsterdam as a representative of the Fugger banking house and business firm of Augsburg. He played a leading role in the city’s cultural and religious life. The skull alludes to the transience of earthly existence, and the red carnation to the hope of eternal life.

Beside the throne, we see Joseph with the lit candle, and to the right the Star of Bethlehem. The wall hangings of southern Sweden, depict highly expressive and well-composed motives, created by popular, and mainly unskilled painters, to decorate homes outside of urban environments and wealthier homes. The scenes depicted are mainly biblical. In the motives we find details from art over the centuries, such as church paintings and illustrated Bibles, but also from the painters own time. Several artists during the National Romanticism and later, admired and were inspired by the painters of the wall hangings from southern Sweden.

By isolating it, it is as if he wanted to get to the very essence of a peach or a gooseberry. Although these four paintings were not conceived as a series, they have formed an ensemble since the
second half of the 18th century."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_5003	Due to the enormous increase of its population, Amsterdam had to expand during the 17th century: the city’s rings of canals were dug in phases. Here we see the Herengracht under construction, with a few lots still empty. This particular section of the canal became the domain of the very richest. Some of the residents earned their money from trade in Asia, and almost every interior boasted Asian luxury goods.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_1606	"Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind. As punishment, Vulcan chained him to a rock, where an eagle pecked out his liver causing him excruciating pain. Here we see Prometheus being chained, his face contorted with fear, while Mercury laughs at him. Van Baburen borrowed the dramatic illumination and the figure’s sunburned hands and faces from
his great model Caravaggio."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2813	"A pewter flagon, a wine glass, an earthenware water jar, a little piece of paper with two music staves and
a didactic inscription, above which hangs a bridle or a rein – these are explicit exhortations to moderation.
Wine must be cut with water; passions must be bridled. This strict message contrasts sharply with the reputation of the artist, who was repeatedly accused of being a whoremonger and a heretic."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3162	Corot belonged to the Barbizon School, which was so widely admired by Hague School artists. Around 1840 several artists settled in the village of Barbizon. They worked en plein air (in the open air) and lived among the peasants. Corot made this painting after a trip to Les Landes, a region south of Bordeaux. It was thus formerly entitled Souvenir de Les Landes.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4076	Calkoen’s audience with Sultan Ahmed III took place on 14 September 1727 and followed a strict protocol. Here we see the retinue, unarmed according to convention, enter-ing the second courtyard of Topkapı Palace. Audiences were always held on the day that the Janissaries, the elite fighting force, received their pay. Just as Calkoen enters, the soldiers lunge noisily at the dishes of rice.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3558	Horses were Breitner’s first subject and remained a life-long passion. This sketch shows how he made a preliminary lay-out of a cityscape. He did this on the spot, using a small panel that fit into the lid of his painter’s box. He depicted the two horses and the horse tram, as well as the contours of the houses, with swift strokes in brown tints over the summary underdrawing.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_384	"Prince’s Day! This popular feast-day celebrated the birthday (14 November 1650) of Prince William III of
Orange-Nassau. How this was done is explained on the piece of paper on the floor in the middle foreground.
This translates as: ‘To the health of the Nassau laddie, in one hand a rapier, and in the other a glass raised gladly.’ This is sure to boost spirits; the revellers take no notice of the portrait of the prince ‘overlooking’ the scene."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063625/HU_280_002	This experimental work consists of two parts. The upper section contains strips of raw textile arranged in wave-like patterns, sewn onto a painted white oil surface. On a separate panel, the lower part is an oil-on-canvas painting, its surface mostly taken up by black writing, as an abstract gesture. From the late 1960s, Ilona Keserü carried out experiments to seek new territories for the medium of painting. She used textiles (canvases) to underline the spatial character of her works. As such, this work points in the direction of object art, as it breaks out of two dimensions and steps into three-dimensionality. The contrast between her use of textile and the abstract expressionist gestures underlines the dichotomy of masculine and feminine means of expression in her art.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_367	"This striking painting is a portrait of a ruler lit only by the flame of a candle. The candle has a symbolic meaning. It serves others with its light, while burning itself out. In other words, self-denial is a noble virtue. William (1650–1702) wears a suit of armour with an
ermine cloak around his neck as a sign of royalty."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4	A swan fiercely defends its nest against a dog. In later centuries this scuffle was interpreted as a political allegory: the white swan was thought to symbolize the Dutch statesman Johan de Witt (assassinated in 1672) protecting the country from its enemies. This was the meaning attached to the painting when it became the very first acquisition to enter the Nationale Kunstgalerij (the forerunner of the Rijksmuseum) in 1880.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_1374	The undecided naval Battle of Dogger Bank in the North Sea against the British (1781) was celebrated as a victory in the Dutch Republic. Under the command of Vice-Admiral Zoutman, the Dutch fleet had finally regained its militancy. Zoutman is portrayed with the decorations he received in gratitude from Stadtholder William V: a gold sword, a Dogger Bank medallion on a ribbon and a medal of honour.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063607/EST_280_004	Viktor Karrus’s Grain for the State represents a trend that developed under Social Realism, which focused on the depiction of idyllic everyday life and transmitted ideological messages indirectly. The painting illustrates how political art employed the poetry of imagery and how powerful its impact could be.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_385	The feast of St Nicholas takes place in December. In the Netherlands, it has been celebrated in the same way for centuries. Good children receive gifts from the saint. The little girl in the foreground, for instance, has a bucket full of treats. Naughty children, like the wailing boy at the left, get only a switch (a bundle of twigs) in their shoe. Jan Steen was a born storyteller. He succeeded in incorporating all of the elements of the popular feast in this picture.

Reflected in it is a window, and a view of a church tower in Utrecht, where Mignon lived. The porcelain bowl from Asia was a sign of prosperity as well as being a showpiece on the table.

The accurately rendered garments and batik motifs indicate not only the region from which these men came, they also provide information about their rank and status. These resolute, confident figures are exceptional and were probably painted by a non-Western artist. In European depictions, Indonesians were usually depicted as adversaries, colonial subjects or ‘innocent’ primitives.

In 1921, she and Evie Hone moved to Paris to train with cubist painters André Lhote and Albert Gleizes. Jellett first exhibited her non-figurative work in Ireland in 1922. She received much criticism but continued to act as an advocate for abstraction and in 1943 was central to the establishment of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art. Together with Hone, she is considered the doyenne of Irish Modernism. Her work featured in IMMA’s 2013 ‘Analysing Cubism’ exhibition.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4282	This canvas was commissioned by Pieter Sterthemius, director of the Hooghly trading post. The scene bustles with activity. Dutch East Indiamen navigate the Ganges River, the director of the trading post visits an Indian dignitary, and at the upper right an act of religious self-castigation is taking place: a man is suspended from a hook in his ribs and spun around a pole.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_443	In composing this scene, Van de Velde relied on various preliminary drawings made from life. His superb skills as a painter of figures and animals were renowned in the 17th century, and he was regularly asked to paint the staffage in the landscapes and city views of other artists.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2317	"It is not certain whether Berchem ever travelled to Italy, but he excelled in rendering idealized scenes of the Italian countryside. His paintings were in great demand precisely because they included all the popular clichés: mountainous landscapes, warm light, hazy blue distances, bright skies and, of course, herders and
shepherds with their cattle and sheep at watering holes or resting in the cool shade."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_44	"In 1667 Ferdinand Bol painted several life-size portraits of Michiel de Ruyter. These were hung in the headquarters of all five Dutch admiralties. This painting went to Middelburg. De Ruyter’s hero status made him a powerful man. In the portrait he is richly dressed and holding his commander’s baton. Around his neck
he is wearing the Order of St Michael, awarded to him by the King of France."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3419	"Cosimo Rosselli was a successful independent master and teacher whose work is typical of artistic production in Florence during the second half of the 15th century. This Nativity scene, which has survived in remarkably good condition, is representative of the Florentine feel for design and colouration, while also showing Rosselli’s reaction to recently imported
works by Flemish painters."

Next to him is his translation of the treatise on architecture by the ancient Roman Vitruvius. The book was published in 1556 with illustrations by the renowned architect Palladio. The latter frequently collaborated with Veronese, the painter of this portrait,
notably on Barbaro’s villa at Maser."

The book in the woman’s hands and her wrinkled skin stand out in this small and otherwise dark painting. Metsu did this to underscore the essence of this popular subject – the contemplation of devotional texts, with a focus on the transitoriness of life.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063605/LAT_280_001	In 1870, after successfully taking part in the Paris Salon, Kārlis Huns went to Normandy and then to Belgium where, it is thought, he painted the “Young Gypsy Woman”. This type of work by the artist – single figure genre compositions – was highly regarded. The fragile figure of the young gypsy, her pleading gaze, the raised tambourine against the falling coin – all the elements add up to a concentrated and sympathy evoking narrative, in which a social tint has been added to the romantic motif. In line with the academic tradition, everything in the painting has been carefully considered and purposefully realised using the artistic means of expression available to the author.

’s-Hertogenbosch. Frederick Henry points his commander’s staff at the Habsburg-occupied city now being stormed by Dutch forces. It was not for nothing that he was nicknamed ‘the conqueror of cities’. He captured a series of cites from the Spanish. The retaking of ‘s-Hertogenbosch in 1629 was one of the most important."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4908	"The two painters produced this portrait to commemorate their youngest brother, Moses, who was born
in 1645. Moses died in 1667 during the storming of Fort Languard near Felixstowe in England. He had served in the Dutch navy against the English since 1664. In the painting Moses is surrounded by symbols that allude to his military life: time (the pocket watch), death (the skull), eternity (the ivy on the rocks) and loyalty
(the dogs)."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063623/GER_280_007	The “Sistine Madonna” is one of most famous Renaissance artworks in the world. Raphael painted the altarpiece in 1512/13 in Rome. It was commissioned by Pope Julius II, who send the picture as a gift to the monastery church San Sisto in Piacenza (a small town southeast of Milan). The open curtains reveal a vision: The Virgin Mary is carrying the Infant Jesus from Heaven down to Earth. St Sixtus is kneeling on the left side, on the ride side St Barbara. Raphael included both of them in the painting because they were venerated at the high altar in the church. During the final stage of his painting process the artist invented the two cherubs at the bottom of the “Sistine Madonna”. After two years of negotiations Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, acquired in 1754 the “Sistine Madonna” for Dresden’s gallery. At the end of World War II the Soviet ‘trophy brigades’ removed the painting to Moscow. Only in 1956 returned the “Sistine Madonna” to Dresden’s Old Masters Picture Gallery.

The bride receives gifts of gold jewellery and sumptuous cloth from her guests. In keeping with sumptuary laws (dress codes), the women do not wear veils inside the house. It is impossible to distinguish between the Greek and Turkish women based on their indoor attire.

were both lieutenant-admirals. All three served the Admiralty of Zeeland, an important part of the Dutch
navy. Evertsen was also a fervent supporter of the House of Orange, as his sash reveals. The cannon and
the naval battle scene refer to his professional career."

Here we see that the walls are densely hung with paintings in gilded frames. Gildemeester stands in the middle of the front room, conversing with one of his guests. The visitors are studying the famous works, including a Rembrandt, visible above Gildemeester’s head.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3780	The highest-ranking Dutch East India Company (VOC) official in Asia was the governor-general. He presided in the Castle of Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia), a fort built by the Dutch. The assembly hall in the Castle of Batavia was the centre of Dutch power in Asia. The walls were hung with portraits of all of the governors-general. Most of the 18th-century examples shown here were painted in Asia, often by anony¬mous artists.

After the meal with the grand vizier, Calkoen and his retinue were presented with kaftans as a sign of hospitality, but also to cover the clothing of the ‘non-believers’. Ahmed sits on a throne, with four princes next to him. Calkoen is giving a speech and will afterwards present his credentials to the sultan.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3948	This portrait invites us to enter the room and enjoy art and music with this gentleman. Typical of the 18th century is the lack of distance between sitter and viewer: the likeness is not intimidating. We stand face to face with a cheerful young man, member of a wealthy Mennonite family from Amsterdam. The visit has caught him unawares: on his shoulder are traces of powder spilled while he powdered his wig.

http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3746	The protagonist in this scene, John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, stands partially concealed in the shade of a group of fanciful trees. It is as if Bloemaert wanted to prove that he could paint virtually anything and everything: a mountainous landscape, leafy trees, as well as figures, either nude or clad in exotic colourful gowns and arranged in complicated poses. All of this proves him to be a master of Mannerism.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2115	Cleopatra made a bet with Mark Antony on who could give the most lavish banquet. She won by dissolving a priceless pearl in vinegar and then drinking the mixture. De Lairesse painted this story like a scene from a play, situating the figures clad in antique costumes in a fitting décor of Classical architecture and furniture. His classicizing style breathed new life into Dutch painting.

His eyes are glazed, as though he is in a stupor. In the 17th century smoking had fervent supporters as well as opponents. Some scholars held that tobacco smoke was therapeutic for both body and spirit; others were
convinced that pipe-smoking was as harmful as excessive drinking."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3753	Leading a 120,000-strong army, the French king Louis XIV invaded the Netherlands on 12 June 1672. Glorifying Louis XIV, the Flemish painter Van der Meulen recorded the military manoeuvre. However, the artist took some liberties: at the time, the King – portrayed here on a grey horse – was actually staying at a nearby monastery.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_1596	The taste for delicate, subtly coloured scenes set against gold backgrounds lasted longer in Siena than in Florence. This work – remarkable for the dramatic isolation of the crucified Christ between his followers (at right) and his persecutors (at left) – was probably the middle in a series of predella panels of the Passion of Christ placed beneath a large altarpiece.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_1864	At the time of the Hague School, the French painter Courbet enjoyed a certain notoriety. He styled himself as a rebel and refused to align himself with any spe-cific style. Instead he began a one-man movement: ‘Realism’. He tried to render the ruggedness of nature by applying the paint to the canvas spontaneously, often with a palette knife. He painted these cliffs in the Jura Mountains in the vicinity of his native Ornans.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_198	"In Greek mythology, satyrs – half-men and half-goats – were said to live in the woods and mountains. In
17th-century literature, they dwelt in the pastoral paradise of Arcadia, where one could lead a carefree life. The satyr here is presented as a shepherd of goats and sheep. He looks up from playing his flute to smile at the viewer."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_645	From 1807 to 1809 Kleijn worked in and around Paris. Two of his landscapes from this period reveal his gratitude to Louis Napoleon. The King had bought two châteaux at Saint-Leu-la-Forêt, while his brother Napoleon owned the Château de Saint-Cloud (portrayed in the companion piece). Although this picture received great praise, it was also criticized for being too detailed and realistic. Kleijn did indeed take a grander approach in his view of Saint-Cloud.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3585	Using thick layers of dark paint, Breitner depicted traditional wooden boats. They seem to be robust and indestructible, but are stuck in the ice. Looming up behind their masts are large steel steamships painted in lighter, almost transparent colours. They sail in open water. Old and modern times are thus contrasted.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4000	Giovanni da Milano introduced richer colour and a more refined style to Florentine painting of the late 14th century. This is seen in the graceful silhouettes of the figures against the traditional gold ground. The panel was probably painted for someone with a special connection to the saints depicted: Francis, Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist and Ignatius of Antioch.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_501	This painting is an ode to chastity. The Virgin sits in an enclosed garden, a symbol of virginity, surrounded by four other virgins (‘virgo inter virgines’). From attributes on their necklaces, they are identifiable as Saint Catherine with a wheel and sword, Saint Cecilia with an organ, Saint Barbara with a tower and Saint Ursula with a heart and arrow.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_1698	With four horses, five dogs, two cows and eleven people on board, this slender ferry appears to be heavily loaded. The boats in the distance are also crowded with passengers. Salomon van Ruysdael was the interpreter par excellence of the flat, watery Dutch landscape. Here he used a tried-and-tested compositional formula: at right, a bank lined with tall trees, and at left, a body of water stretching out to the horizon.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2851	The Old Testament tells the story of the people of Babel who wanted to build a tower that would reach to heaven. God punished them for their pride: he confused their common language so they could no longer understand one another. This is one of the earliest painted depictions of this story; it also affords a fairly reliable glimpse of late medieval building practices.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2063623/GER_280_003	The idea of a spring that brings back youth to aging people, is known from antiquity to our days. In this paintings, the most famous pictorial formulation of the theme, Cranach builds on topics from medieval imagination.  From the left old women are brought to undress, get into the water and be reconverted right in the middle of the basin to young girls. On the right side they climb out of the bath, then dress up nicely and enjoy together with handsome men the pleasures of the dance, the table and love. Only the women have to enter the pool, while the men on the left side, who are also old and frail, are transformed by the affection of their companions. But the ultimate cause of rejuvenation is earthly love, represented by the Venus figure on the fountain-heading the center of the basin.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_3920	The man leans out of a window. In his right hand he holds up a gold ring set with a stone. His left hand rests on a touchstone, an instrument for assessing the purity of gold and silver objects. The sitter might be the goldsmith Bartholomeus Jansz van Assendelft. In 1617, the year the portrait was painted, he was appointed assay-master of the Leiden goldsmiths’ guild, which would explain the inclusion of the touchstone.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_216	Two contemporaries had themselves portrayed by Rembrandt in historicizing costumes as characters from the Bible. The couple’s tender embrace is at the centre of this poignant painting: the man’s loving gesture is returned with a gentle caress. The figures and their poses agree with the study (No 67), only the figure of King Abimelech spying on them is missing. We, the viewers, assume his role as witnesses of their clandestine love.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_2231	The French army, which had invaded the Netherlands at the request of the Dutch Patriots, had already reached Utrecht when Daendels, a Dutch general in French service, sent Krayenhoff to Amsterdam. He was to ask the city council to step aside so that a new –Patriot –government could be installed before the French arrived. The change of authority took place in Amsterdam that same evening, 18 January 1795.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4482	This bird’s-eye view of the Mollucan island of Ambon has a small portrait of its first Dutch governor, Frederik Houtman, at lower right. At centre is the Portuguese Fort Victoria, which was seized by the Dutch East India Company in 1605. The raid was prompted by the lucrative clove production. Houtman initially maintained good contacts with the Ambonese chiefs, but the company mounted punitive expeditions to prevent the sale of the spice to rivals.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_654	After the defeat of Napoleon, the director of the Rijks-museum, Apostool, was responsible for retrieving the art that had been stolen from the Netherlands and taken to France. In 1816 he returned triumphantly with most of it. This portrait was probably made on that occasion. Apostool wears the order of the knighthood that he received. The catalogue in his hand, from the Musée Français in Paris, is open to the Dutch school.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_4	"A servant bringing a letter temporarily interrupts a meeting. The other five men are the regents of the
Amsterdam Spinhuis, the female house of correction. The women imprisoned there for theft or begging spent most of their days spinning. Affluent citizens like these gentlemen administered these sorts of institutions. Thus was civic peace maintained."
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_A_4980	In his paintings, Longhi usually poked gentle fun at the everyday activities of the Venetian elite. This is not, however, the case here. It is simply a portrait of a family drinking coffee, with the lady of the house taking centre stage. The conspicuous inclusion of the servant is noteworthy. He must have been a valued member of the household.
http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/90402/SK_C_144	Hobbema painted more than thirty ‘portraits’ of watermills, based on drawings he had made in the east of the Netherlands. He drew the same mill from various angles, so that one could see exactly how it was assembled. Here he was interested primarily in the technical construction of the wooden water channel, rendered in grey, which stands out against the landscape.
