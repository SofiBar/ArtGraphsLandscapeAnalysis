He considered painting a part of the class-conscious, socialist ideological fight. He was also an active  art theoretician.\n\nThe subjects of his pictures are workers, peasants, suburban streets, his native town, Dés, and the banks of the river Szamos, with trees bending into the water and bathing cattle. One of his most mature early works is ""Midday Rest"" which was presented to the Museum of Fine Arts by the Ministry of Culture in 1947. His art evolved from Cubism and Constructivism and later his means of expression became richer and his drama stronger. The colours of his later works are chiefly browns, grays and brick reds. In the thirties the principles of Derkovits and Dési Huber were adopted by the Group of Socialist Artists.']"

In the study prepared for the painting, which was eventually entered for the competition, a conspicuous group of pagan Hungarian was present. When the final picture was completed in 1875, there was no indication of the pagans, i.e. the opposition; after the political compromise between Hungary and Austria in 1867, those who financed the competition preferred a rendering of this decisive event without allusions to any conflicts. Vajk (the later King St. Stephen) is seen kneeling in the foreground, to be baptized by Saint Adalbert, dressed in ornate attire.\n\nWith the help of his ability to paint pompous materials and set up vivid compositions - which he acquired from his master, Piloty, and by studying the art of Rubens and Tiepolo, Benczúr created a representative tableau of Historicist painting. It is not without reason that Benczúr became the king of painting in Hungary during this period, the favourite of rulers and the aristocracy; moreover, he became a professor at the Academy of Art in Munich and later at the Master\'s School in Budapest. He possessed both technical virtuosity and the ability to conform with the requirements of his patrons - two assets which were necessary for obtaining his position in art.']"

Later the same theme reappeared in his series The Life of the Woman and The Life of the Lascivious Woman. He painted his ""The Dancer"" around 1875. Here he seems to have been much preoccupied with lighting and the impressionistic delineation of the tired dancer at rest. Despite the warm yellow-red tones, a quiet resignation dominates the painting - this mood is probably in reference to the letter the fragile female beauty is holding in her hand.']"

E kezdeti, posztnagybányai kifejezésmódtól jutott el a 30-as évek elejére egyfajta vizionáló - gyermekkori emlékeit, a zsidó liturgia jeleneteit lebegően, álomszerűen megjelenítő - expresszionizmushoz, melynek kialakulásában meghatározó élményt jelentett számára Chagall művészete és 1937-es párizsi találkozása a festővel.\n\nÁbrázolásmódjának elkomorulásához természetesen erősen hozzájárult az Európát fenyegető háborús veszély, majd a II. világháború, amelynek kitörése után Ámos fizikai léte, egzisztenciája is bizonytalanná vált.\n\nFestészetének zaklatottá válását, messianisztikus voltát szimbolikus-expresszív-szürreális stílusának változásait arcképein is nyomon követhetjük. Az 1930-as Ady-maszkos önportréja még hagyományos beállítású, festésmódját is inkább a fény-árnyék hatások, a tömegek és nem a kontúrok kiemelése határozza meg. A Párizsban készült (1937) önarcképének modellátása, a figura képszéllel történő merész metszése viszont már megegyezik szöges, kalapácsos önportréjával, amely a leghangsúlyozottabban vágott, csupán a rekvizitumokat - szög, kalapács -, illetve a fejet premier plánban bemutató alkotása. E képen a környezet eltűnik, csak az elkínzott arc és az említett jelképek vannak jelen, jól kifejezve a szinte minden két háború közötti zsidó művész-értelmiség - Farkas István, Radnóti Miklós - pályáját jellemző fatalizmust.\n\nA festmény zöldes-sárga-barna színei az elmúlást sugallják. Ebből az iszapszín koloritból véreznek ki a körvonalakat megerősítő vörösek.', ""Ámos' career started under the influence of postimpressionism. His activity was particularly influenced by Róbert Berény and Aurél. After his initial post-Nagybánya style, he arrived at an expressionsm full of visions of his childhood, and of Jewish lithurgy. Chagall's art was of decisive importance in its development but the fact he met the great artist in person in 1937 was also significant.\n\nHis style became gloomier which was largely due to the war threatening Europe, World War II, and before long, Ámos' life and existence became uncertain.\n\nHis art became rhapsodic and messianic. His portraits reflect changes of symbolic-expressive-surrealistic style. His self-portrait of 1930 had a traditional arrangement, his style was characterized by the contrast of light and shadow, by contours and mass highlighted. The way he modelled his self-portrait in Paris in 1937, and the daring way the figure was cut off by the edge of the picture are similar to his self-portrait with nail and hammer, which is cut in a particularly stressed way: it depicts only accoutrements (nail and hammer) and the head in close-up. In this picture, the surroundings vanished, only the tortured face and the symbols are present expressing fatalism typical of Jewish intellectuals (e.g. István Farkas, Miklós Radnóti) between the two world wars.""]"

However, after his first visit to Szolnok in 1875, he spent every summer at its artists\' colony. His approach to ""plein air"" painting was formed by the influence of Millet and Bastien-Lepage. The landscape of the Great Hungarian Plain suited his method admirably: instead of Academic artificiality, Deák-Ébner wished to reveal the vivid complexity of life. If not in his style, Munkácsy\'s influence was discernible in the compassionate way he depicted the hard life of his impoverished models. ""Boat Warpers"", painted in 1878, is an excellent example of his pictures produced in Szolnok. The most striking qualities of these paintings are the beauty of tones and - especially in the case of the smaller works - the way the artist captured the sun-lit colour values.']"
http://lod.sztaki.hu/data/item/17434	"['Molnár painted this composition during his stay in Rome. The picture reflects the influence of Italian painting and that of neoclassicism. As for arrangement, it can be traced back to less major masters of trecento and quattrocento. There is tension between the foreground, where the madonna is portrayed, and the background. The figure of Joseph, the carpenter, suggests the devotion of religious pictures, the stylized landscape based on a strict perspective revives the compositons of early renaissance  but Mary\'s airy figure embodies 20th c. women. Her fashionable clothes different from those in traditional iconographies intensify the profane character.  This kind of dualism appears in several of Molnár\'s biblical pictures. His compositions reflect meditative contemplation rather than religious  devotion. Afer he had finished the picture, he gave it to Sári Megyeri, a writer and poetess, as a present, who lived in Paris and whose works Molnár illustrated. The title ""Madonna in Pullover"" came from her. She, in her turn, gave the picture to the Hungarian National Gallery as a present.', 'A mester a kompozícióját római tartózkodása idején festette. A kép híven tükrözi az olasz festészet hatását, magán viseli a neoklasszicizmus jellegzetességeit. Képi világát tekintve a mű a  trecento és quattrocento kismesterek hagyományaira vezethető vissza. A kép előterének Madonna ábrázolása és a háttér megkomponálása között ellentét feszül. József, az ács alakja a szentképek ünnepélyes áhítatát sugallja, a szigorú perspektívára épülő stilizált táj a kora reneszánsz kompozíciók világát éleszti újjá, de Máriájának légies alakja inkább a 20. századi nőtípus megtestesítője. A hagyományos ikonográfiától eltérő jellegű divatos ruházata is a profán színezetet fokozza. Ezzel a kettősséggel Molnár C. Pál legfőbb biblikus témájú festményén találkozhatunk. Képei inkább lírai meditatív szemlélődést sugallanak, mint szent áhítatot. A festményt a művész nem sokkal elkészülte után Megyeri Sárinak, a később Párizsban élő író-színésznőnek ajándékozta, akinek műveit illusztrálta is.

He kept open house for any Hungarian artist who happened to be travelling in Italy. The Hungarian press followed his work with interest, and even in his lifetime he was celebrated as the ""Hungarian Claude Lorrain"".\n\nThe ""Fisherman"", one of his most popular and largest canvases, was painted in the last period of his life.

http://lod.sztaki.hu/data/item/16606	"[""A book of engravings of Kupecky's paintings published in Nuremberg in 1745, contains an engraved copy of this picture, made by Bernhard Vogel in 1736. This mezzotint engraving identifies the represented person as: R. Donauer, Pict. Moscov. Thus the painting depicts the painter Gottfried Donauer or Danhauer who, according to the contemporary writer von Hagedorn, was of Swabian origin and a clockmaker like his father. He went to Italy to study music and painting with Bombelli. Later he moved to Russia where he died in 1737 in St. Petersburg. Kupecky who according to his biographer Füssli, while returning from Rome, became acquainted in Venice with the portrait painter Sebastiano Bombelli, may have met Donauer in Venice. Thus the picture probably was made at the beginning of Kupecky's career, in Italy and then taken by him to Vienna and to Nuremberg. However, some copies of Vogel's engraving call the picture The Allegory of Hearing. Hence it is possible, that the painting, which for a time was attributed also to Ádám Mányoki, belonged to a series representing The Five Senses. (a similar pictorial approach in the series Five Senses by Johann Heinrich Schönfeld once in Salzburg). As we do not know any authentic portrait of Donauer, and Kupecky's authentic Italian works have hardly survived, the identification and dating must remain open to question.""]"
http://lod.sztaki.hu/data/item/16136	"['Delicate  expressionism, a decorative inclination  to folk art and an abstract summarizing are features which characterize Béla Kádár\'s art. His style developed indipendently of Hungarian art. It can be linked to Hungarian avantgarde in colours, composition, elements of form and motifs recalling Hungarian folk lore. ""Mother with Child"" is a peculiar interpretation of the symbol Madonna in a city surroundings. The artist seems to have been engaged in problems of composition: the relationship between the mystic mother of god and modern architecure, the harmony between surrealistic and abstract portrayal, and the portrayal of forms in space reduced to planes with the portrayal of time and space. The picture is dominated by emotions: the mother with her child in a sea of houses  in an alienated city with an animal symbolizing faithfulness and a sense of life.The underlying ideas are humanity and a feeling of reliance on one another.', 'Finom expresszionizmus, a népi díszítésmódot is felhasználó dekoratív hajlam, összegező elvonatkoztatás - mind olyan ismérvek, amelyek Kádár Béla művészetének körülírására alkalmazhatók.

A festmény pontos dátumában az kutatók nem tudnak megegyezni, de szinte bizonyos, hogy a hatalmas főmű (Talpra magyar) kínlódással, kétségekkel teli munkálatai közben, egy boldog fellélegzéskor születhetett (Genthon, Lyka és Radocsay 1901-re, Réti 1902-re, Dévényi és Aradi 1904-re datálja).

(Genthon, Lyka and Radocsay think it comes from 1901, Réti  speaks of 1902, and Dévényi and Aradi vote for 1904.)  The romantic character of the artist breaks out unexpectedly to blur almost academic naturalism. There are no traces of drawing, objectivity or careful character portrayal.

A female figure in Michelangelo\'s style is reclining on a drape rich in folds, with her back against a broken tree trunk. In the middle, there is a man: he is kneeling and lifting a hand (he had a flower in the hand originally), and there is a male nude standing on the right. The three figures are strongly built, they have strong muscles. Their apparent restfulness hides tension. At first glance, the group can be characterized by a state of balance, only the figure in the middle is doing some movement, thus connecting the three of them. The gesture of the female figure (she is lifting her arm) is taken over by the figure in the middle which then dies out in the arms of the man. The earth and the hills in the background, the clouds in the sky and the broken trees are painted  with the same emphasis and plasticity. The colours of the picture are highly interesting: a contemporary critic said that the picture was lacking in colours, or in other words, was too rich in forms to the disadvantage of colours. The painter gave up colours and individual features in order to indicate that this is not a concrete scene. Its message is a more general one. The picture is obviously a symbolic one but its content is ambiguous. The two men can be identified with him, the viewer can see two phases of a series of events. The title can be of some help: ""Longing for Pure Love"". One must not think of an earthly love, it is psychich affectaion and a mental longing to reach the unreachable.

Their backs are grooved, and their feet reaching back are not perfectly carved, a sign that the statues were designed for wall-niches. Pál Esterházy is represented in somewhat historizing clothes (coat-of-arms and short shirt), with a wig, and the Order of the Golden Fleece, which he obtained in 1681. His wife wears Hungarian apparel, flowered shoulder stays, a peated-shoulder blouse, a girdle decorated with precious stones, and a necklace. Although the details of the statues, especially the soft folds of the woman's clothes and the modelling of the heads, are decorative and pleasant, the unknown sculptor, who surely was not one of the first-class masters of the period, did not manage to individualize his figures.\n\nThe statues were bought in 1849 by the Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest and, according to the seller's information, they originated from Pozsony. The represented persons were identified by Mária Aggházy, according to whom the statues were made not much after 1681, and were destined for bronze foundry workshop of Balthasar Herold in Vienna. They served as cast moulds for a bronze tomb which, because of Herold's death in 1683, was never realized. On the basis of their stylistic features, Aggházy considered the master of the statues to be Johann Christian Pröbstl, a Brünn burgher since 1682, who in 1720 also executed there the model of General Souches' bronze kneeling sepulchral statue. Her hypothesis was generally adopted by art literature.\n\nRecently discovered sources, however, somewhat modify this hypothesis. Indeed, the four wooden statues represent the Esterházy brothers (Pál and Ferenc) and their wives, and were certainly made on Pál's commission. However, they were not cast moulds, but statues for the Esterházy Mausoleum, which was connected to the cloisters of Kismaton's (Eisenstadt) Franciscan church. Although the Esterházy family had a sepulchral place of their own in Nagyszombat's (Trnava) Jesuit church built by the father of Pál, Palatine Miklós Esterházy, its crypt proved damp, so Pál Esterházy wanted to build a mausoleum in the same church, as is attested by his will of 1678. According to his plans, this was a two-level sepulchral chapel with a lower tomb-level, and an altar on each floor. The two levels were bound by a lattice window, through which the tombs at the lower level were seen from the upper one. The model for this may have been the Archduke Mausoleum in Graz, where, at the Jesuit school, Pál Esterházy began his studies. However, in the end Pál Esterházy built his family mausoleum not in Nagyszombat, but in residence of his estates, in Kismarton's Franciscan church. He himself was buried here. Although the crypt was completely rebuilt in 1856-57 when it obtained its current forms, its previous appearance can be reconstructed on the basis of a detailed description of the interior from 1835-36.""]"

http://lod.sztaki.hu/data/item/17406	"[""The Holy Spirit church in the city of Sopron has two side-altars. One is the Holy Cross altar, about which the 1782 contract drawn up with the painter, István Dorffmaister and the sculptor, Ferenc Müller has remained to us. The other is the Pieta altar decorated by the picture exhibited here. Very early in the year 1783 a cabinet-maker was paid for having dissembled and reassembled the high altar and the two sidealtars in 1782. One of the (old) side-altars may have been the Pieta one whose altarpiece was perhaps made at the same time with the high altar's painting (cat. no 108Ö, as its technique of execution suggests. We consider both that altarpiece and this side-altarpiece as works made in the 1750's by Joseph Ignaz Mildorfer.\n\n18th century Pieta compositions usually feature few figures: in most of them, there is but an angel to share the grief of Mary shown broken over her dead son. However, the Sopron altarpiece was composed by its painter from five figures, arranging St. John supporting Mary, Mary Magdalene wiping Christ's wounds and a woman embracing his hanging arm around the central figure of Christ himself lying in her mother's lap. The picture's basic tone is grim and dark. Its figures are almost bodyless. Glaring lights illuminate the faces depicted in sharp foreshortening and some widely fluttering draperies that make the composition almost burst. The figures of the windblown vision are mostly linked by the strange expressive forms of the strongly accentuated hands in a feature characteristic of Mildorfer's art in the style of the 1750s. His painting at Sopron is not related to his early Pieta (St. Moritzen bei Telfs, 1742) but rather to the sketch at Graz, similarly unquiet in the intensity of expression (Graz, Joanneum). Here again, similarly to many other works of his. Mildorfer set out from a composition by Troger: his figure of Christ is almost a paraphrase of Troger's Pieta in Vienna (Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien), yet without the latter's power of plasticity and confidence of composition. Unlike the high altar's painting at Sopron, this picture was not attributed to Dorffmaister and got its only mention in Sopron's topography referring to it as a painting close to Franz Sigrist."", 'A soproni Szentlélek-templomban két mellékoltár áll. A szentkereszt-oltár, amelyről fennmaradt a festő Dorffmaister István és szobrász Müller Ferenc szerződése 1782-ből, s a Pieta-oltár, amelyet a kiállított kép díszít. Az 1783-as év legelején pedig azért fizettek az asztalosnak, hogy a templomban a főoltárt és a két mellékoltárt 1782-ben szétszedte és újra felépítette. Az egyik ""régi"" mellékoltár a Pieta-oltár lehetett, amelynek oltárképe, formajegyei alapján, egyidőben készülhetett a főoltárképpel. S miként azt, úgy e mellékoltárképet is Joseph Ignaz Mildorfer 1750-es években készült alkotásának tartjuk.\n\nA 18. századi Pieta-kompozíciók általában kevésalakosak, s a halott fiát sirató Mária gyászában legtöbbször csak egy-egy angyal osztozik. A soproni oltárképet viszont a festő öt alakból komponálta, s az anyja ölében fekvő Krisztust a Máriát támogató Szent Jánossal, a Krisztus sebeit letörlő Mária Magdolnával s lehajló karját átölelő asszony alakjával vette körbe. Komor, sötét a kép alaptónusa. Figurái már-már testetlenek. Az éles fények a kompozíciót szinte szétfeszítő, szélesen lobogó drapériákat s erős rövidülésben ábrázolt arcokat világítanak meg. A szélfútta látomás alakjait leginkább az erősen kihangsúlyozott kézfejek, különös, expresszív formái kötik össze, mindez Mildorfer művészetében az 1750-es évek stílusának jellegzetessége. Soproni festménye nem korai Pietá-jának (St. Moritzen bei Telfs, 1742) rokona, sokkal inkább a kifejezés intenzitásában hasonlóan zaklatott grazi vázlaté (Graz, Joanneum). Itt is, mint annyi képen, Mildorfer Troger-kompozícióból indult ki. S Krisztus figurája Troger bécsi Pietájának (Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien) valóságos parafrázisa, csak éppen annak plasztikai ereje és kompozíciós biztonsága nélkül. A képet - eltérően a soproni templom főoltárképétől - nem sorolták Dorffmaister alkotásai közé, s említeni is csupán a soproni topográfia említi, mint Franz Sigristhez közeálló festményt.']"

Ezt Eszterházy Imre érsek, Magyarország, prímása megbízására emelték. A stallumokat, amelyek az 1497-ből való gótikus kóruspadokat váltották fel. 1736. november 5-én, Szent Imre napján használták először.\n\nMindmáig csupán ezek a kanonoki feljegyzésekből 1880-ban publikált adatok szólnak a stallum felállításáról, további levéltári anyag azóta sem került elő. Így azután semmit sem tudunk azokról az asztalosokról és fafaragókról, akik a művet kivitelezték. A kóruspadok kinézetéről és elhelyezkedéséről fogalmat nyújt a bécsi Franz Altnak a Szent Márton-dóm szentélyéről 1848-ban készített lavírozott rajza, amelyet 1970-ben Bécsben, a Dorotheumban árvereztek és azóta lappang. Egy 20. századi másolata is ismert Csákós Józseftől, amely a pozsonyi városi múzeumban található (Bratislava, Mestké múzeum).\n\nA dómnak a 19. század 60-as éveiben végzett purisztikus restaurálása során eltávolították a barokk stallumokat, a helyükbe neogótikusak kerültek. Az ülések maguk Bécsbe jutottak, az egykori Kinsky-palotába, a büsztöket Enea Lanfranconi műgyűjtő szerezte meg. Az irodalom egy része, amelyhez 1929-ben még Pigler Andor is csatlakozott, Johann Messerschmidt alkotásainak tekintette őket. Albert Ilg már 1893-ban azonban felismerte összefüggésüket Georg Raphael Donnerrel és kilenc darabot bemutatott a jubileumi Donner-kiállításon.\n\nA 20. század elején a mellszobrok Budapestre kerültek és huszonnégy darab, amelyeket annak idején megszerzett az Iparművészeti Múzeum, ma már a Magyar Nemzeti Galériáé és az állandó kiállításon látható. A maradék négy büszt magántulajdonba került és csak 1943-ban bukkantak fel egy budapesti árverésen, majd újra eltűntek.\n\nA sorozattal Aggházy Mária foglalkozott behatóan, aki szintén a Donner-műhelybe sorolta azt. Nézete szerint stilisztikai okokból elsősorban Jacob Schletterer és Franz Kohl jöhet számításba mint Donner tervei után faragó, kivitelező művész. Véleményünk szerint több szobrász is osztozhatott Donner megbízásából ezen feladaton, szám szerint hatan vagy heten, akik valószínűleg nem mind tartoztak közvetlen munkatársai körébe, hanem önálló, helyi mesterek is voltak köztük. Donner segédei közül Kohl mellett Gottfried Frietsc és Ludwig Gode is számba jöhetett, Schletterer viszont aligha, mert ő ekkor már mint önálló mester Zwettlben dolgozott. Az ikonográfiai programot Aggházy Mária csak részben fejtette meg és az sok szempontból nyitva maradt. A büsztök sorrendje bizonytalan, még ha újabban az aljukon bevésett római számokat fedeztek is fel, amelyek bizonyára 1736-ból valók és a stallumon történt eredeti elrendezésükre utalnak.\n\nA kiállított női mellszobornak nincs attribútuma, ami tematikailag jobban meghatározhatná. Aggházy Mária a sorozat többi női büsztjével együtt Szibillának értelmezte, de lehetséges az is, hogy fiatal női szentet testesít meg. Hasonló típus gyakran előfordul Donnernál. A legközelebbi rokonságban a ""Mária vigasztalása-"" és a ""Levétel a keresztről""-domborművek Mária Magdolna-ábrázolásaival áll. A távolságtartó, sima formaadás alapján Gode vagy Kohl kivitelezésére gondolhatunk. A büszt alsó felületén bevésett IIII római szám szerint a mű eredetileg a stallum jobb vagy bal oldalán negyedikként következett. A kerek talapzat minden bizonnyal utólag került rá, amikor a stallumot eredeti helyéről eltávolították.', 'The work belongs to the twenty-eight busts that decorated the former choir stalls of St. Martin\'s church in Pozsony (Bratislava). The stalls which replaced a series of Gothic choir stalls from 1497, were commissioned by Imre Esterházy, Prince-Archbishop of Hungary, and put into use on 5 November 1736, the feast day of St. Imre (Emeric).\n\nThese data, recorded by the chapter of St. Martin\'s, and published in 1880, are the only ones about the construction of the stalls. Hitherto no other archivalia had been found. Thus we know nothing about the wood-carvers and joiners who took part in implementing the work. Only a pen and washed drawing of the sacristy, made in 1848 by the Viennese painter Franz Alt - sold by auction at the Viennese Dorotheum in 1970, and since then disappeared - gave some notion of the former and layout of the stalls. A copy of the drawing, made by József Csákós at the beginning of the 20th century, can be found in the Bratislava Mestské múzeum.\n\nIn the course of the purist restoration of the church, carried out in the sixties of the 19th century, the Baroque stalls were removed and replaced by Neo-Gothic ones. The former stalls go to Vienna, in the then Palais Kinsky, while the busts were bought by the art collector Enea Lanfranconi. Some art literature, supported in 1929 even by Andor Pigler, still attributed them to Johann Messerschmidt. However, in 1893 Albert Ilg realized their connection to Donner, and exposed nine of them at the Donner anniversary exhibition.\n\nThe busts got to Budapest at the beginning of the 20th century. The twenty-four pieces, that time bought by the Iparművészeti Múzeum, can actually be seen in the permanent exhibition of the Magyar Nemzeti Galéria. The other four busts got into private property. They appeared in 1943 at an auction in Budapest, but later disappeared.\n\nThe firs art historian who investigated the details of the problem was Mária Aggházy. She also attributed them to Donner\'s workshop. In view of stylistic considerations, she considered that it had been primarily Jacob Schletterer and Franz Kohl who, on the basis of Donner\'s designs, had executed the busts. In our opinion there were more - six or seven - wood-carvers who took part in this work. Probably they didn\'t all belong to Donner\'s workshop; there could have been some independent, local masters as well, who carried out some busts commissioned by Donner . Among Donner\'s assitants not only Kohl, but also Gottfried Fritsch and Ludwing Gode can be considered; but not Schletterer, who at that time was already working in Zwettl as an independent master. The iconographic programme was only partially unravelled by Mária Aggházy, and her explanation is still open to question in many respects. We don\'t know the original succession of the busts, even though engraved Roman numerals have been recently found at the bottom of some of them. These date probably from 1736 and might refer to the original layout of the stalls.\n\nThe exhibited female bust has no attributes that could make her identification possible. Aggházy considered her, as all the other female busts of the series, a Sybil, but it is possible that she represents a young female saint. The figure recurs several times in Donner\'s ""oeuvre"". It is closely related to the figure of Mary Magdalen in the reliefs ""Consolation of Mary"" and ""Descent from the Cross"". The distant manner of modelling may refer to Gode or Kohl as executive masters. At the bottom of the bust the Roman numeral IIII is engraved. Thus the work could originally have been the fourth piece of the series on the right or left side of the stalls. The circular socle was added certainly later, after the removal of the stalls.']"

The most general interpretation is  a contrast between objective existance and the soul\'s longing for freedom. Bernáth\'s ""Morning"" suggests different interpretations. The landscape which is seen from the window is cold, distant and somewhat lifeless on the one hand, and the world of objects with modest appearance, is intimate and lively. Bernáth is an intellectual  and rational creature, who is a sensitive dreamer with a world of his own, he breathes life into the lifeless, he gives a personality to obejcts, his faithful companions.\n\nThe open window of the picture divides the composition into a foreground and a background: the still life of the foreground, the usual obejcts of everyday life become more beautiful and emphatic in the warmness of sunshine and poetic imagination. The landscape outside the window is distant, cool and strange: it is a counterpoint of  the foreground. The warm whiteness of the casement of the window perpendicular to the plane of the wall and the aquarium provides for a transition. Orange coloured patches of golden fish in the aquarium radiating the warmness of an inner world, project liveliness and movement to the splendid blue of the water. The landscape seen from the window keeps returning in Bernáth\'s works. The contrast of the world inside and outside inspired the artist all through his life.']"

The painting is the meditative confession of someone trying to reconcile the conflict between a bourgeois upbringing and artistic self-realization. The painting reveals how the artist went beyond the search for order as exemplified by Cubism, thereby approaching the dreamworld of the Surrealists while never really leaving the reality of his own constricted, immediate surrounding. The pale, translucent colours reveal an extraordinary sensitivity, while artist's subjects expose his sense of seclusion. Behind the apparent tranquility of this self-portrait there is an inner tension which characterizes all of Farkas's remarkable oeuvre as well as his own death at Auschwitz.""]"

There is a long breast-work along the road, projecting a sharp shadow on the cobble stones of the road. A cart with a donkey is standing crosswise on the road as if the animal had jibbed on seeing the wild waves. The waggoner is sitting indifferently in the driver\'s seat. A man is standing with his back to the load that is on the cart. A horse can be seen on the side of the picture. A figure is standing on the balcony  of a house and is keeping watch. A cyclist can be seen somewhat away from him, his shadow is projectedon the wall. There is one more figure  in the picture: a man sitting in  a boat. There are no more signs of human beings around.

Of his life we know little beyond the fact that he studied at the Vienna Academy and was active in that city. He was admitted to the school probably between 1783-1786; he had a stimulating master in Johann Christian Brand, a teacher of landscape painting who at one time had been active in Hungary. In January 1787 Schallhas shared with Anton Troger an Art School Prize, his own painting being based on a theme from Gessner's idylls. In 1790 he became a member of the Academy and in 1795 was appointed teacher in the Faculty of Landscape Painting. He died an early death in 1797 by which time he was an assistant professor under Friedrich August Brand.\n\nThe five oil paintings and about one hundred drawings surviving from an oeuvre still not fully researched, show Schallhas to have been an artist sensitive to nuances of colour, capable of delicate brushwork and interested in the relationship between man and nature, he was fascinated by the beauty of the Austrian countryside and the drawings he made on his journeys reflect personal experiences. In his oil paintings he tried to give a more general representation of airy landscapes, hazy light and local atmosphere. His choice of subject suggests a slightly romantic outlook and, especially in his sketches, a leaning towards historicism. His landscapes with wide horizons, the details merging hazily with the sky, are often charged with tension but the view itself is always composed of quietly arranged harmonious structural elements. In this picture the approaching storm is indicated by changes in the light, dark shadows of the accumulating clouds and a rising wind that stirs up the dust raised by the homeward bound cattle. And this is represented by the painter in hazy colours and with a touch of nostalgia.""]"

They are miner houses of Nagybánya. The view opens over a fence which is badly in need of repair. Decorative colours in the foreground, the middle and the background show a symmetry of some kind. The same applies to the formal division of the composition. Greens and yellows on fractions of forms appear in the middle of the picture, they are located between patches of blue, white and rust. The freshness of the brushwork can be recognized in layers of paint, especially in the snow in the foreground of the picture.\n\n""Landscape with Fence"" is perhaps one of Ziffer\'s pictures  which proves that he is a master of colours, and that he interpretes forms with very simple tools.']"

The shadow of the cat, a piece of bread, a bird singing and the pinkish-blue sky in the background lead to all sorts of associations. Studying order may be important for other reasons, too. Derkovits developed  a peculiar method of composition which is capable of supporting understanding. The range of his colours became complete only around 1930. His shades of blue linked him with the masters of Gresham. While colours indicated the cloudless joy of ""pure art"", even these subdued colours were capable of polarization.

This included relief compositions as well in which the subject was the preaching of the Gospel. This gilded wooden relief of St. Peter preaching, together with its counterpart known as St. Paul's Sermon in Athens, were two such reliefs which at one time decorated the front of a pulpit. Their place of origin is not known. They show some relationship to similar works by Lajos Gode, one of Donner's most prolific pupils, in particular to the reliefs in the Jesuit church in Pozsony which, in spite of rococo enrichments, follow in essentials Donner's classical style.\n\nThe figures of apostles created by Gode may have served as models for the long-faced standing or recumbent provincial men and women in this relief. The way in which the artist tries to suggest space is, however, much more primitive than in Lajos Gode's works. Against a background closed by a window and a curtain, the figures are arranged in two planes in a relatively small space indicated by the illusory perspective produced by the flagstones and platform. St. Peter, a key hanging from his waist, arms outstretched as he preaches, is the central figure of the composition; the figures forming the congregation, worked as if they had been applied separately, fall into two groups. The rather simple technique of embossing, with ample use of curtains, clouds and steps to suggest space, is familiar from the works of sculptors active in the mining towns of Upper Hungary. The same means had been employed for example by Martin Vogerl for the execution of the reliefs on the base of the Immaculata monument in Nyitra, and also for the series of reliefs on the column of the Holy Trinity which he created jointly with Stanetti in Körmöcbánya. Many of Stanetti's sculptures in the round are directly analogous with the figures in the relief and since there is evidence that he undertook also the decoration of a pulpit in the Great Church in Körmöcbánya, it is possible that the two carvings found their way to the museum from there.""]"
