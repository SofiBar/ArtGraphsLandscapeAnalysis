http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floating_Clouds_(artwork)	"Floating Clouds (sometimes called Flying Saucers by the artist) is a work of art by American sculptor Alexander Calder, located in the Aula Magna of the University City of Caracas in Venezuela. The 1953 work comprises many 'cloud' panels that are renowned both artistically and acoustically. The piece is seen as ""one of Calder's most truly monumental works"" and the prime example of the urban-artistic theory of campus architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva. Originally intended as only an art piece, the panels were moved inside the Aula Magna to resolve the poor acoustics caused by the hall's design; the hall has since been said to have some of the best acoustics in the world. The Floating Clouds are named specifically in the UNESCO listing of the campus as a World Heritage Site, and are greatly renowned in Venezuela."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoyard_with_a_Marmot	"Savoyard with a Marmot is an oil on canvas painting of 1716 by the French Rococo artist Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684–1721). It depicts an itinerant musician/raconteur from Savoy. The painting depicts his clarinet and his trained companion marmot. Savoyards were known to utilize the animals at traveling shows and local fairs, having trained them to ""tell fortunes"" by pulling carded predictions from a hat. ""Lied des Marmottenbuben"" by Goethe, and Les deux petits savoyards both depict this. The painting is said to depict the Savoyard's disassociation and loneliness; Savoy was a poor region, and emigres were often marginal outcasts within the lands they decamped for. Earlier, in 1715, Watteau had drawn an older Savoy woman with her boxed marmot in ""Standing Savoyarde with a Marmot Box"", before expanding the depth of the depiction with this work. The painting was a part of Catherine the Great's collection, before transferring to the Hermitage Museum."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Lord_George_Graham_in_his_Cabin	Captain Lord George Graham in his Cabin is a 1745 oil-on-canvas painting by the English artist William Hogarth. A conversational picture, it shows Captain Lord George Graham, of the Royal Navy, in the cabin of his ship with several people. The painting was probably commissioned by Graham to commemorate a naval battle he had fought recently. While commanding a 24-gun sixth rate, he had been one of three British ships to attack a squadron of three powerful French privateers and their prizes. The British were successful in their engagement, capturing all of the prizes, and all but one of the privateers. Lauded for his achievements, Graham was given another, larger, ship to command. The painting is probably set aboard this new command, the 60-gun HMS Nottingham, and shows Graham relaxing in the great cabin before a meal, smoking a pipe. With him are the ship's chaplain and clerk, who sing and listen to music played by a black servant. A steward brings a roast duck to the table. Two dogs are also present in the scene, one joins in the singing, the other wears a wig and reads a sheet of music. The scene contains elements of satire and symbolism, in common with Hogarth's other works. The relaxed scene contrasts the tension of the naval battle it commemorates, with elements of humour including the officious pose and behaviour of one of the dogs, who apes Graham's official position. The steward looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, while obliviously tipping gravy down the chaplain's back. The positioning and depiction of Graham and the black servant invite comparisons, with Hogarth's presentation of black subjects in paintings being studied by later academics. Hogarth drew from his own experience in group portraits, and was probably influenced by an earlier cabin work by Bartolomeo Nazari. Graham's enjoyment of the painting was short-lived, he died in 1747. His family kept the portrait in their collections until 1932, when it was sold to Sir James Caird, who subsequently donated it to the National Maritime Museum, where it remains.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Madonna_and_Child_(Bellini,_Detroit)	The Madonna and Child or Madonna with the Christ Child Blessing is a 1509 oil on panel painting by Giovanni Bellini, commissioned by the Mocenigo family and remaining with them until 1815. It is now in the Detroit Institute of Arts. It shows similarities to his 1505 Madonna del Prato (London) and his 1510 Madonna and Child (Milan); all three have a Giorgione-influenced landscape background (here with a shepherd or villager), separated from the figures by a green curtain and with hazy blue mountains in the far background obeying the rules of aerial perspective. The landscape or meadow in the background symbolises the medieval symbol of Mary's virginity, the hortus conclusus. In her left hand Mary holds a book, a symbol of her fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies; on its front cover are the date and the artist's signature. It was recorded as belonging to Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchesse de Berry and hanging in Palazzo Vendramin Calergi (her Venetian home) between around 1844 and 1854 before an attempt was made to auction it in Paris on 19 April 1865 on behalf of the Duchesse du Berry or her son Henri, Count of Chambord. However, it did not sell and so remained with the Duchesse, who moved it to Austria in 1868. It passed to the Count on her death in 1870, then to his widow Maria Theresa in 1883 and finally to the Count's niece on Maria Theresa's death. The niece died in 1893, passing it to another member of the Bourbon family, Jaime, Duke of Madrid. Its final private owner was the Vicomte de Canson, who sold it to its present owner in 1928.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_Mirror_(M._C._Escher)	Magic Mirror is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in January, 1946. It depicts a mirror standing vertically on wooden supports on a tiled surface. The perspective is looking down at an angle at the right hand side of the mirror. There is a sphere at each side of the mirror. The main focus of the image is a procession of small griffin (winged lion) sculptures that emerge from the surface of the mirror and trail away from it in single file. Both the angular reflection of the tiles and the offset between the reflection of the sphere in front of the mirror and the sphere behind it prove it is a mirror. Yet the reflection of the griffin procession continues to emerge from behind the mirror. The griffin processions of both sides loop around to the front and enter a tessellated pattern on the tile surface.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait_of_Susanna_Lunden	"Portrait of Susanna Lunden or Le Chapeau de Paille (The Straw Hat) is a painting by Peter Paul Rubens, in the National Gallery, London. It was probably painted around 1622–1625. The portrait's subject has not been securely identified, but she may be Susanna Lunden, née Fourment (1599–1628), the older sister of Rubens' future second wife Helena Fourment. If the identification is correct, the portrait probably dates to the time of Susanna's marriage to her second husband, Arnold Lunden, in 1622. The ring on her finger might mean that the painting is a marriage portrait. Rubens' portrait was engraved in 1823 by Robert Cooper (active 1795–1836). At that time, it acquired the name Le Chapeau de Paille, which incorrectly describes the hat as ""straw"" (paille). A sketch of Rubens' painting (ca. 1823–24) by J. M. W. Turner is in the Tate. In 1781, Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun and her husband visited Flanders and the Netherlands, which inspired her to paint Self-Portrait with Straw Hat (1782), a ""free imitation"" of Rubens' Le Chapeau de Paille."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosham_Head	The Bosham Head is part of the largest Roman statue found in Britain, a large, 375-pound (170 kg) sculpted piece of stone that was discovered in Bosham, near Chichester, around 1800. It later resided for some time in the garden of the Bishop of Chichester's palace before being exhibited in the Chichester Museum where it now stands. In 2013, 3D laser scans led Dr Miles Russell and Harry Manley of Bournemouth University to conclude that enough survived to suggest that the head was that of a lost sculpture of Emperor Trajan, perhaps erected by Hadrian at the mouth of Chichester Harbour.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cabinet_painting	"A cabinet painting (or ""cabinet picture"") is a small painting, typically no larger than two feet (0.6 meters) in either dimension, but often much smaller. The term is especially used for paintings that show full-length figures or landscapes at a small scale, rather than a head or other object painted nearly life-size. Such paintings are done very precisely, with a great degree of ""finish"". From the fifteenth century onward, wealthy collectors of art would keep these paintings in a cabinet, which was a relatively small and private room (often very small even in large houses) to which only those with whom they were on especially intimate terms would be admitted. A cabinet, also known as a closet, study (from the Italian studiolo), office, or by other names, might be used as an office or just a sitting room. Heating the main rooms in large palaces or mansions in the winter was difficult, so small rooms such as cabinets were more comfortable. They offered more privacy from servants or other household members and visitors. Typically, a cabinet would be for the use of a single individual; a large house might have at least two (his and hers) and often more. Later, cabinet paintings might be housed in a display case, also known as a cabinet, but the term cabinet arose from the name (originally in Italian) of the room, not the piece of furniture. Other small and precious objects, including miniature paintings, ""curiosities"" of all sorts (see cabinet of curiosities), old master prints, books, or small sculptures might also be displayed in the room. A rare example of a surviving cabinet with its contents probably little changed since the early eighteenth century is at Ham House in Richmond, London. It is less than ten feet square, and leads off from the Long Gallery which is over a hundred feet long and twenty feet wide, giving a rather startling change in scale and atmosphere. As is often the case, it has an excellent view of the front entrance to the house, so that passersby and daily activities can be observed. Most surviving large houses or palaces, especially from before 1700, have such rooms, but they are often not displayed or accessible to visitors. The magnificent Mannerist Studiolo of Francesco I Medici in Florence is larger than most examples and rather atypical in that most of the paintings were commissioned for the room. There is an equivalent type of small sculpture, usually bronzes. The leading exponent in the late Renaissance was Giambologna, who produced sizeable editions of reduced versions of his large works, and also made many exclusively in small scale. These sculptures were designed to be picked up and handled, even fondled. Small antiquities were also very commonly displayed in such rooms, including rare coinage. Small paintings have been produced during all periods of Western art, but some periods and artists are especially noticeable for them. Raphael produced many cabinet paintings, and all the paintings of the important German artist Adam Elsheimer (1578–1610) could be so described. The works of these two were much copied. The Dutch artists of the seventeenth century had an enormous output of small paintings. The painters of the Leiden School were especially noted ""Fijnschilders"" or ""fine painters"" producing highly finished small works. Watteau, Fragonard and other French 18th-century artists produced many small works, generally emphasizing spirit and atmosphere rather than a detailed finish. In modern times the term is not as common as it was in the 19th century, but remains in use among art historians. A ""cabinet miniature"" is a larger portrait miniature, usually full-length and typically up to about ten inches (25cm) high. These were first painted in England, from the end of the 1580s, initially by Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver. In 1991, an exhibition entitled ""Cabinet Painting"" toured London, Hove Museum and Art Gallery and Glynn Vivian Art Gallery and Museum, Swansea. It included more than sixty cabinet paintings by contemporary artists."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ince_Hall_Madonna	"The Virgin and Child Reading is an oil painting of uncertain date. It is a mid-to-late 15th century imitation of the work of the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, possibly after a now-lost original painting by him from 1433 - another copy of the same work is now in the Colegiata church in Covarrubias, Spain. It is first documented in 1619, when it was in Sicily and then re-appeared in Charles Blundell's collection at Ince Blundell Hall near Liverpool early in the 19th century, meaning it is sometimes known as the Ince Hall Madonna. George Frederick Zink restored it there in 1922. It was acquired from the Weld-Blundell family by the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in Melbourne in 1922 using funds from the Felton Bequest. The inscription on the wall at top left reads: ""COPLETV ANO D M CCCC XXXIIJ P IOHEM DE EYC BRVGIS"". This translates as ""Completed in the Year of Our Lord 1433 by Jan van Eyck, Bruges"". To the right of the tapestry is van Eyck's personal motto in Greek letters ""ALC IXH XAN"" (""As I Can""), playing on the similarity between his surname and 'IXH' (an approximate transliteration of ""ich"" or ""I"" into ancient Greek characters)."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melencolia_I	"Melencolia I is a large 1514 engraving by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer. The print's central subject is an enigmatic and gloomy winged female figure thought to be a personification of melancholia – melancholy. Holding her head in her hand, she stares past the busy scene in front of her. The area is strewn with symbols and tools associated with craft and carpentry, including an hourglass, weighing scales, a hand plane, a claw hammer, and a saw. Other objects relate to alchemy, geometry or numerology. Behind the figure is a structure with an embedded magic square, and a ladder leading beyond the frame. The sky contains a rainbow, a comet or planet, and a bat-like creature bearing the text that has become the print's title. Dürer's engraving is one of the most well-known extant old master prints, but, despite a vast art-historical literature, it has resisted any definitive interpretation. Dürer may have associated melancholia with creative activity; the woman may be a representation of a Muse, awaiting inspiration but fearful that it will not return. As such, Dürer may have intended the print as a veiled self-portrait. Other art historians see the figure as pondering the nature of beauty or the value of artistic creativity in light of rationalism, or as a purposely obscure work that highlights the limitations of allegorical or symbolic art. The art historian Erwin Panofsky, whose writing on the print has received the most attention, detailed its possible relation to Renaissance humanists' conception of melancholia. Summarizing its art-historical legacy, he wrote that ""the influence of Dürer's Melencolia I—the first representation in which the concept of melancholy was transplanted from the plane of scientific and pseudo-scientific folklore to the level of art—extended all over the European continent and lasted for more than three centuries."""

It is considered to be one of the most important religious icons of Venezuela. Divina Pastora is the patron saint of the city of Barquisimeto and of the Venezuelan National Militia. The image dates from 1735. Divina Pastora is celebrated in a procession on January 14 of each year, when a massive Marian procession occurs, considered to be one of the largest in the world, attracting millions of pilgrims. The statue is removed from its shrine and is carried on the main streets of Barquisimeto in a procession which starts at the Iglesia de la Divina Pastora in Santa Rosa until it reaches the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. This procession is unlike those mass Marian celebrations in the world where the image does not leave its temple. This procession occurs due to the devotion the people of Barquisimeto have towards it as gratitude towards saving the city from a cholera outbreak that occurred in the city in the 19th century. In 2016, 4,000,000 faithful honored the Divina Pastora.
